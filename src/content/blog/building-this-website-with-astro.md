So I was thinking about building a portfolio website for the longest time now but I could never really make the time to do it up until now. Then comes my friend <a href="https://github.com/IslARY" target="_blank">Winters</a> who showed me the power of Astro and it's island style component design. I felt invincible.

I wanted to build a website that is fast, responsive, and easy to customize. So I used Astro, which is a lightweight framework for building static website that leverages modern web technologies such as web components which basically works like an island and server-side rendering.

## Tech Stack

I used Astro as the framework in combination with popular front-end libraries such as:
- DaisyUI
- Boxicons
- Tailwind CSS
- Web3Forms

_DaisyUI_ is a component library for _Tailwind CSS_ that provides ready-to-use UI components such as buttons, forms, and modals. _Boxicons_ is a library of free icons that can be easily added to your project. _Tailwind CSS_ is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly style your HTML elements without writing custom CSS. And _Web3Forms_ is a tool for creating forms that can be integrated with popular email marketing services such as Mailchimp and Sendinblue.

To get started, you'll need to install _Astro_ and the required dependencies using npm. Once you have Astro installed, you can create a new project and start building your website.

Next, you can integrate _DaisyUI_ and _Boxicons_ into your project by installing them via npm and importing them into your HTML files. This will give you access to a wide range of pre-built UI components and icons that you can use to create a professional-looking website.

You can then use _Tailwind CSS_ to style your HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of utility classes that you can use to style your elements without writing custom CSS.

Finally, you can use _Web3Forms_ to create forms for your website that can be integrated with popular email marketing services. This will allow you to collect user data and build your email list while providing a seamless user experience.

In conclusion, by using _Astro_ in combination with _DaisyUI_, _Boxicons_, _Tailwind CSS_, and _Web3Forms_, you can build a fast, responsive, and easy-to-customize website that meets your needs. Give it a try and see what you can create!
